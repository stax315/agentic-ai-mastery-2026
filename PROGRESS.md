## Week 1: Foundation & Verification

### Goals
- [x] Learn planning-first workflow
- [x] Build first self-verifying agent
- [x] Establish error prevention patterns

### Achievements
- Day 1: CalculatorAgent v1 & v2 (85 tests)
- Day 2: [TBD]
...

### Key Learnings
1. Planning prevents errors
2. verify() method enables self-testing
3. Code review catches what tests miss

### Metrics
- Tests written: 85
- Errors: 0
- Patterns added: 27

### Reflection
No errors occurred throught 85 tests... very rare.
