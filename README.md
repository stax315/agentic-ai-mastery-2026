# 24-Week Agentic AI Mastery Journey

## 🎯 Mission
Master Agentic AI development from fundamentals to production-ready systems in 24 weeks using Claude Code and the "championship process" - a systematic, planning-first approach to AI development.

## 📊 Journey Status
- **Current Week:** Week 1
- **Current Day:** Day 1 ✅ COMPLETE
- **Total Errors:** 0 (Planning-first success)
- **Agents Built:** 2
- **Patterns Documented:** 9

## 🏆 Day 1 Achievement: Zero Errors
Started the journey with zero errors by following the planning-first workflow. Built calculator agents with self-verification capabilities, demonstrating that proper planning prevents errors before they happen.

## 🗺️ The 24-Week Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- ✅ Day 1: Verification loops, planning-first workflow
- Week 1: Basic agents, tool calling, verification patterns
- Week 2: API integration, error handling, rate limiting
- Week 3: Parallel development, multi-agent coordination
- Week 4: Automation, custom commands, agent factory

### Phase 2: Scaling (Weeks 5-12)
- Specialized sub-agents
- Production patterns
- Advanced orchestration
- Real-world applications

### Phase 3: Mastery (Weeks 13-24)
- Agent swarms
- Self-improving systems
- Production deployment
- Autonomous development

## 📚 Core Principles

### Rule #1: ALWAYS PLAN FIRST
Every piece of code starts with a detailed plan. This prevents errors and builds systematic thinking.

### Rule #2: DOCUMENT EVERY ERROR
Errors are learning opportunities. Each one gets documented with prevention strategies.

### Rule #3: VERIFY EVERYTHING
Code isn't done when it runs - it's done when it proves itself correct.
